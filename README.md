## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learnt how to show completely different images, depending upon the device width, using the ![picture tag](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50375128).

```css
<h1>Resize Window</h1>
<picture>
  <source srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/1400" media="(min-width: 1400px)"/>
  <source srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/1200" media="(min-width: 1200px)"/>
  <source srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/800" media="(min-width: 800px)"/>
  <source srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/600" media="(min-width: 600px)"/>
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400" alt="example"/>
</picture>
```
